### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

  - Yes, the topics discussed in the labs prepared me to complete the assignment. From learning about HTML and CSS to JavaScript and APIs. Although, the pop-up feautures and youtube embedding were never discussed, the course portal provided us enough resources to take on the stretch feature.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
  - If I had more time, I would allow the user to be able to filter movies based on their genre. In addition to now playing movies, I would also add recent top box office movies. I would also add the feature that would allow users to select a movie theatre; and in the pop up, in addition to movie details, it would also have the showtimes based on that movie theatre.
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

  - In my project demo, fortunately, everything did go as planned. From my peer's demo, I noticed that instead of having the user delete the search word themselves there could just be a button that would clear it automatically.
